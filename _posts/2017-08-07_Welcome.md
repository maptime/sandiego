#Welcome to Maptime San Diego!

Do any of these sound like you: I love maps, but I've never touched the command line. I'm a CS major, but the only maps I use are from Google and Waze. I don't know anything about codiing or mapping, but it sounds cool. No matter your skill level or geographical knowledge, you're welcome to Maptime San Diego! 

So this does sound a lot like me, but what is Maptime exactly? Maptime is a space for geographers, engineers, cartographers, computer scietists, and, most of all, people to come together to learn how to map and tackle difficult mapping projects together. It's a community joined by the love of maps, passion for learning and desire to contribute to open source mapping efforts. In Maptime San Diego, we'll specifically learn how to use software like [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/), [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/), [Planet](https://www.planet.com/), [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) and more!

This sounds perfect for me, but who are you? My name is Madison, and I used to go to Maptime San Francisco/Oakland. After finishing my Geography/GIS degree at UC Berkeley, I wanted to help restart Maptime in my home city. If you're interested in attending, stay tuned for upcoming events and keep in contact!
