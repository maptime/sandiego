1. Edit the `title` in the front matter (above)
2. Update date/time.  on macOS, use a command similar to
``` 
date -jf "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z" "2018-10-12 08:00:00 -0700" +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" 
```
3. Update the `rsvp` in the front matter.  You can use event brite or leave at the twitter link and people can RSVP at twitter if you instruct them to.
4. Update the introduction.  Pro-tip — Write it in the voice of what you would write in twitter, so you can just copy/pasts
